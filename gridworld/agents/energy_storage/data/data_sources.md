## Data sources
This environment only has the state of charge (SOC) as its observation, so I want to add data for load, load forecast, electricity price (LMP), electricty price forecast, wind forecast, solar forecast, and MOER. 
- I will use the python package grid status for load, load forecast, wind forecast, solar forecast, and electricity price (I am using Historical Locational Marginal Pricing for the electricity price).
- I will download MOER data from the California Self-Generation Incentive Program here. Note that MOER data is regional. The three main Default Load Aggregation Points (DLAPs) are San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E), Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E), and Southern California Edison (SCE). More notes on the characteristics of each DLAP are listed below. For my thesis, I will focus on using a portion of the SDG&E DLPA for training with the remaining portion reserved for testing, given its relatively high solar penetration and thus need for energy storage optimization to leverage the volatility in MOER and LMP. However, investigating the effects of domain shifts is a stretch goal.
    - SDG&E DLAP: San Diego has relatively high solar penetration, leading to significant midday dips in MOER due to solar generation. Evening ramp-ups can also lead to higher MOER due to natural gas peakers.
    - PG&E DLAP: PG&E has a mix of hydropower, nuclear (Diablo Canyon), and solar. Marginal emissions might be lower due to cleaner baseload resources.
    - SCE DLAP: SCE serves a large area with diverse energy sources but often relies heavily on natural gas during peak hours. Its MOER could show a more consistent higher baseline compared to SDG&E.
- Price forecasting is a little more involved. The hourly day-ahead market provides an hourly forecast for the next day and is attainable via grid status, but since decisions are made every 5 min interval, it is very desirable to have real-time forecast. This is an active and separate area of research (see this for a summary of methods), so many RL methods assume a perfect forecast by just indexing future prices from historical data at each time step. Of all existing forecasting methods, LSTM tends to perform the best (based on this). Implementing this forecasting method is a stretch goal 

# Data availability 
- Note: CAISO only provides last 39 months of data
- Load (gridstatus.CAISO.get_load): Aug 01, 2021  - Oct 31, 2024 (5 minute intervals, gridwide)
- Load forecast (gridstatus.CAISO.get_load_forecast): Aug 01, 2021  - Oct 31, 2024 (hourly intervals, forecasted at the start of every month for the entire month, gridwide)
- Electricity price (gridstatus.CAISO.get_lmp):  Aug 01, 2021  - Oct 31, 2024 (focusing on the lmp_real_time_5_min market but also has RTM 15 minutes and DAM hourly). There are 1874 nodes (and it is unclear from the naming where each node is located) but only 3 trading hubs: NP15, ZP26, and SP15. I am going to use pricing from SP15 because of its overlap with SDG&E (see map here: https://www.researchgate.net/figure/CAISO-price-zones-and-local-distributional-companies-sources-CAISO-37-and-FERC-36_fig1_347835373)
- Solar and wind forecast (gridstatus.CAISO.get_solar_and_wind_forecast_dam): Aug 01, 2021  - Oct 31, 2024; available for the whole region but only using SP15, in accordance with MOER and LMP.
- MOER: Jan 01, 2017 - Oct 31, 2024; focusing on SDG&E DLAP but also available for PG&E DLAP and SCE DLAP. Note that I am only using MOER version 2.0 because MOER version 1.0 has incomplete data.
